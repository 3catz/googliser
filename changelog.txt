changelog:
v1.14 (2016-06-08) Concurrent image downloads now available! Fixed problem of URLs without specified extensions. Files now download sequentially. Added options for concurrent downloads, timeout, tries, quiet. Renamed 'l - limit' parameter to 'f - failures'. Now correctly aborts download when failures_limit is reached.
v1.13 (2016-06-07) Now called googliser! Changed internal file names to match. Removed curl and now only using wget. Search results download concurrently.
v1.12 (2016-06-05) Download 400 image search results! Added return code for image download failed. Shifted return code for thumbnail gallery creation failed from 5 to 6 (sorry!). In-place progress display. Thumbnail gallery creation can be disabled. Added timers for debug log.
v1.11 (2016-05-29) Now provides the option for writing a debug file (good for examining commands with parameters!). Will only thumbnail first image in multi-image files. Wget error codes are translated into text. Added option to change failure limit from command line. Performs exact search query now.
